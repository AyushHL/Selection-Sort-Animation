# Welcome to Selection Sort Animation  

A visual representation of the Selection Sort algorithm implemented in C.  

---

## **Features**  
- **Sorting Visualization**: Visual representation of the Selection Sort algorithm steps.  
- **Color-coded Elements**: Differentiates selected elements, current comparisons, and sorted elements.  
- **Console-based Animation**: Uses ANSI escape codes to animate sorting steps in the console.

## **Installation**  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Selection-Sort-Animation.git  
   ```  

2. Compile the code:  
   ```bash  
   cd Selection-Sort-Animation  
   gcc -o selection_sort SelectionSortAnimation.c  
   ```  

3. Run the animation:  
   ```bash  
   ./selection_sort  
   ```  

The animation will demonstrate the Selection Sort algorithm on a predefined array.  

---

## **Usage**  
- Watch the console output to observe each step of the Selection Sort algorithm.  
- Elements are color-coded (red for selected element, green for sorted element) to visualize the sorting process.  
- The animation will demonstrate how Selection Sort arranges elements in ascending order.

## **Files**  
- **SelectionSortAnimation.c**: Contains the main logic for the Selection Sort algorithm and console animation.  
- **README.md**: This file providing information about the project.  

---

## **Tech Stack**  
- **C Programming Language**  
- **ANSI Escape Codes** for console manipulation
