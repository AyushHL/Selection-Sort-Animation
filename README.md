The code includes standard C libraries: stdio.h, stdlib.h, windows.h, and unistd.h. Note that unistd.h is for Unix-like systems, while windows.h is specific to Windows.
clrscreen() uses system("cls") to clear the console screen on Windows. It also resets the console text color.
PrintArr(int arr[], int n, int red, int green, int top, int bottom) prints the array elements, highlighting specific indices with different colors: red, green, top, and bottom.
PrintTop(int arr[], int n, int index, int spaces) prints a highlighted element at the top of the array with yellow color. It's used to show the current element being compared.
PrintBottom(int arr[], int n, int index, int spaces, int cursor) prints a highlighted element or cursor at the bottom of the array with green color.
SelectionSort(int arr[], int n) implements the selection sort algorithm with animations. It repeatedly finds the minimum element from the unsorted portion and places it at the beginning.
Within SelectionSort, calls to PrintTop, PrintArr, and PrintBottom functions provide visual feedback, highlighting the current elements being compared and swapped.
main() initializes an array arr[], displays an introductory message, and prints the unsorted array. It calls SelectionSort to sort the array and finally prints the sorted array.
Sleep and fflush(stdout) are used to pause the program to allow viewing the printed output before clearing the screen.
To change the input array, modify the initialization of the arr[] variable in the main() function. Also, adjust the number of elements and values as needed.
