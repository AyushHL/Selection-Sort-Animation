Welcome to Selection Sort Animation, a visual representation of the Selection Sort algorithm implemented in C.

Features
•	Sorting Visualization: Visual representation of the Selection Sort algorithm steps.
•	Color-coded Elements: Differentiates selected elements, current comparisons, and sorted elements.
•	Console-based Animation: Uses ANSI escape codes to animate sorting steps in the console.

Installation
1.	Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/selection-sort-animation.git

2.	Compile the code:
cd selection-sort-animation
gcc -o selection_sort main.c

3.	Run the animation:
./selection_sort

The animation will demonstrate the Selection Sort algorithm on a predefined array.

Usage
•	Watch the console output to observe each step of the Selection Sort algorithm.
•	Elements are color-coded (red for selected element, green for sorted element) to visualize sorting process.
•	The animation will demonstrate how Selection Sort arranges elements in ascending order.

Files
•	main.c: Contains the main logic for Selection Sort algorithm and console animation.
•	README.md: This file providing information about the project.

Tech Stack
•	C Programming Language
•	ANSI Escape Codes for Console Manipulation
